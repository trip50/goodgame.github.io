    <p>An interesting fact about rattlesnakes is that their rattles are made up of interlocking segments of keratin, the same material found in human hair and nails. Each time a rattlesnake sheds its skin <strong>(which can happen several times a year)</strong>, a new segment is added to the rattle. Contrary to popular belief, the number of segments does not indicate the snake's exact age because the rattle can break off and grow irregularly over time <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/rattlesnake">rattlesnake</a> </p>
